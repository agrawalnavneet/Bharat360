# Fixing 500 Server Error on Render

## Common Causes of 500 Errors:

1. **Static files not collected** - Fixed by adding `collectstatic` to build command
2. **Database migrations not run** - Already in build command
3. **Missing environment variables** - Need to set DEBUG=False for production
4. **Database path issues** - SQLite on ephemeral filesystem

## Steps to Fix:

### 1. Update Build Command in Render Dashboard

Go to Render Dashboard → Settings → Build Command

Change it to:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py collectstatic --no-input && python manage.py migrate
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Go to Render Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables

Add these:
- `DEBUG`: Set to `False` (for production)
- `SECRET_KEY`: Generate a new secret key (optional but recommended)

### 3. Check Logs

Go to Render Dashboard → Logs to see the actual error message

Common errors you might see:
- Database locked (SQLite issue)
- Static files not found
- Template errors
- Import errors

### 4. If Using SQLite (Current Setup)

**Important**: SQLite on Render's free tier can cause issues because:
- The filesystem is ephemeral (resets on restart)
- Multiple processes can't write to SQLite simultaneously

**Solution**: Consider upgrading to PostgreSQL (free tier available on Render)

## Quick Fix Commands:

If you have shell access, you can run:
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic --no-input
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## After Fixing:

1. Redeploy the service
2. Check logs for any remaining errors
